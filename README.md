# AI-Crypto-Synergy
This study investigates the potential synergies between AI data centers and cryptocurrency mining to understand how this strategic coupling can alleviate dependence on fossil-fueled regional power grids while achieving cost-effective and climate-neutral operations. The following contents are included in this repository to support our key findings:
1. Codes: include all codes to evaluate the strategic scenarios.
2. Data: include all data used during the analysis.

## Requirements
To run the codes in this repository, the following Python and core packages must be installed (version is given for refenrence):
- GAMS Distribution 40.1.0
